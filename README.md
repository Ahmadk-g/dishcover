# Project Planning

## Agile Development

Dishcover was developed using Agile methodology, allowing for iterative and flexible development throughout the project. By utilizing GitHub Projects and Issues, the development process was efficiently managed through a Kanban-style board. Each part of the app was divided into Epics, which were then broken down into user stories and tasks, enabling continuous progress tracking and timely delivery of functionality. This approach ensured that changes could be easily incorporated, leading to a refined and user-centered final product

- An **Epic** is a large feature or objective that’s too big to complete in one go. It’s broken down into User Stories, which are smaller, actionable pieces of functionality. The epics can be viewed on this project's [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/Ahmadk-g/projects/4).

- **User Stories** are brief descriptions of a feature from an epic from the user's perspective. They define what the user needs and include acceptance criteria that detail the requirements for completion. Each user story usually consists of several tasks necessary to meet the user’s needs. The user stories are introduced as issues and can be found [here](https://github.com/Ahmadk-g/dishcover/issues)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

- Is a method for ranking user stories based on their importance: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. This approach helps prioritize features and tasks, ensuring critical user stories are completed first, while less crucial ones are addressed later.

### Kanban board

- A visual tool in agile project management. It visually represents the workflow stages and the status of individual user stories. 

The Kanban board for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/Ahmadk-g/projects/4).
