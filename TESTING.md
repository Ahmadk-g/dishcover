## Automated Testing 

Automated testing in Django and Python is essential for maintaining code quality and reliability. Djangoâ€™s built-in testing framework, which integrates with Python's unittest module, supports the creation of various tests. For example, test_forms.py and test_views.py focus on unit and functional tests for forms and views, verifying that they work correctly. Automated testing helps quickly identify and address issues, maintain code integrity, and improve the overall stability and performance of the application.

### Running the Tests

**1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Launch your termianl or command prompt.

**2. Navigate to Project Directory:** Use the terminal to navigate to the project's root directory where manage.py is located.

**3. Run the Tests:** Execute the Following Command:
```bash
python manage.py test
```
This command triggers the Django test runner, which locates and runs all test cases across the project. It scans the project's directories, identifies test files, and runs each test case, providing detailed results, including the number of tests, any failures or errors, and an overall summary.

Django will create a temporary test database, run the tests, and then discard the database. This ensures that your testing is clean and doesn't affect your production data.

## Responsiveness Testing

Responsiveness testing was conducted using Chrome Developer Tools to ensure Dishcover provides an optimal user experience across various devices. During development, the following devices were emulated:

- Desktop
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Mobile Phones

This approach ensured the webpage adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations, maintaining functionality and aesthetics across all devices.


## Validator Testing

### Python
